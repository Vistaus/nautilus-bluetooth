Nautilus Bluetooth
==================

A simple Nautilus extension written in C that adds a “Send via Bluetooth” entry
to Nautilus' right-click menu.


Get involved
------------

The package needs help with internationalization. If a translation into your
language is missing and you wish to get involved, here is what to do.

Let's say you want to create a Dutch translation of **nautilus-bluetooth**. This
package comes with only two strings to translate:

1. “Send via Bluetooth”
2. “Send the selected files to a Bluetooth device”

First thing to do is to make sure that `gettext` and `intltool` are installed
on your system. Then clone this repository and launch the following four
commands:

``` sh
cd nautilus-bluetooth/po
intltool-update -p --gettext-package=nautilus-bluetooth
msginit -l nl
rm nautilus-bluetooth.pot
```

Now edit the `po/LINGUAS` file and add a new line containing the abbreviated
name of the new language (`nl`).

Finally, open the file `po/nl.po` and translate the two strings above. All you
have to do now is to commit your changes.

If you want to update an existing Dutch translation to the most recent changes
in the extension source code, launch

``` sh
cd nautilus-bluetooth/po
intltool-update -p --gettext-package=nautilus-bluetooth
mv nl.po nl.po.bak && msgmerge nl.po.bak nautilus-bluetooth.pot > nl.po
rm nautilus-bluetooth.pot nl.po.bak
```

For any issue, [drop me a message][1].

nautilus-bluetooth
==================

A simple Nautilus extension written in C that adds a “Send via Bluetooth” entry
to Nautilus' right-click menu.

------------

The package needs help with internationalization. If a translation into your
language is missing and you wish to get involved, here is what to do.

Let's say you want to create a Dutch translation of **nautilus-bluetooth**. This
package comes with only two strings to translate:

1. “Send via Bluetooth”
2. “Send the selected files to a Bluetooth device”

First thing to do is to make sure that `gettext` is installed in your system.
Then clone this repository and launch the following two commands:

```
cd nautilus-bluetooth/po
msginit -l nl
```

Enter your email address and press enter. Now edit the `po/LINGUAS` file and add
a new line containing the abbreviated name of the new language (`nl`).

Finally, open the file `po/nl.po` and translate the two strings above. All you
have to do now is to commit your changes.

For any issue, [drop me a message][1].

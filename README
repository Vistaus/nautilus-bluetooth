Nautilus Bluetooth
==================

A simple Nautilus extension written in C that adds a “Send via Bluetooth” entry
to Nautilus' right-click menu.


Get involved
------------

The package needs help with internationalization. If a translation into your
language is missing and you wish to get involved, here is what to do.

Let's say you want to create a Dutch translation of **Nautilus Nluetooth**
(`nl`). This package comes with only two strings to translate:

1. “Send via Bluetooth”
2. “Send the selected files to a Bluetooth device”

First thing to do is to make sure that **GNU Autotools** and **GNU gettext**
are installed on your system. Then clone this repository and launch the
following commands:

``` sh
./bootstrap
make -C po nautilus-bluetooth.pot
(cd po && msginit -l nl)
./bootstrap --clean
```

Now edit the `po/LINGUAS` file and add a new line containing the abbreviated
name of the new language (`nl`).

Finally, open the file `po/nl.po` and translate the two strings above. All you
have to do now is to commit your changes.

For any issue, [drop a message][1].
